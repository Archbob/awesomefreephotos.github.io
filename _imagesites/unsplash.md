# A general quality indicator, on an integer scale of 1 to 3, 3 being the highest.
# This could be contentious, and is admittedly vague. A better system would have 
# quality indicators for different measurable aspects. For now, using only 3 levels
# allows us to highlight sites that are particularly good or particularly bad, while
# not allowing sites to jockey too much for position.
# Take into account photo quality, searchability/categories/tags, interface.
quality: 3 

# List the types of images offered through the website. Try to use tags already used with other sites if relevant.
